<p class="speech"> Boo!!! Hiya there!! We are the creators of this web app. Our names are Yuritzi, Hannah, Yanet, and Elizabeth.</p>

<p> Tis me Elizabeth, nice to meet you. We created this web app as a way to not die of absoute boredom. When we are bored we can search up a haunted place and go explore. Well... they can I will use this web app as a way to avoid such areas, thank you very much. Cause ain't nobody got time for demons, possessed beings, and all that jazz. </p>

<p class="speech"> Hi, I'm Yuritzi. I agree with Elizabeth not going near any of the places. It's haunted no way am I going to be possessed.</p>

<p class="speech"> What up? Yanet here. Also you guys do know we are exploring these places for this project right?</p>

<p class="speech"> Hello I'm Hannah. I'm so excited to go exploring I have everything ready.</p> 

<p class="speech"> The hell you mean we are going exploring? I don't accept this what if I die?! I'm not ready to go to heaven. -Elizabeth</p>

<p class="speech" > Heaven? Please if anything you are going to hell but don't worry I'll see you there.- Yanet</p>

<p class="speech"> I'm not prepared to go exploring!!-Yuritzi</p>

<p class="speech"> It's alright I got all the things we need in this bag. You don't need to prepare.-Hannah</p>

<p class="speech"> Uhhh... I meant mentally prepare. What if we actually find a ghost?!! Like Elizabeth said what if we die? I can't die yet I still need to listen to more BTS. Don't make me go!! -Yuritzi</p>

<p class="speech"> We won't die, and it's probably not that scary we will be with you the whole time. Plus we are going during the day. We also have flashlights for when it gets too dark. The sooner we get there the more day time we have to explore. -Hannah</p>

<p class="speech"> I can't I am allergic to haunted places!!! Like really allergic!!! -Elizabeth</p>

<p class="speech"> Stop being a scaredy cat! -Yanet</p>

<p class="speech"> Fine. -Elizabeth</p>
